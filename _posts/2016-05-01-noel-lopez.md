## <center>"THEY ARE THE ONES"</center>

This is a **photo installment-slash-series-slash-journal** that I have been thinking of creating for some time now, not only to celebrate these lives and the amazing humans that live them but to also share the effect they’ve had on my own life and on the journey that I am willing to take on and finish along with them. Since I am usually not fond of nor quite great and eloquent in speaking high praises of people aloud, I thought this was second best and what made the most sense in order to put out the thoughts I have about these special people I’m lucky to know and the ones that have inspired me, so far, along the way.

### <center>WEEK ONE</center>

#### <center>NOEL LOPEZ</center>

A Chicago native, he moved to Boston for college and after graduating he began working in social work. Some of the things he enjoys are the outdoors, kids, and singing. But aside from his thirst for adventure, his eagerness to help children, and his passion for music, his love for God absolutely exceeds.

One of the funniest and earliest memories I have with Noel happened when he started praying for a friendship between the two of us and all I could do was laugh. In that moment I thought it was kind of stupid, and I still joke about it with mentions of “Wow, I’m so glad we’ve formed this great acquaintanceship,” but I knew he was very serious since he just recently moved in with me at the time (and became an official **RoxBro**). I may have not appreciated that prayer then, but I definitely do now.

If you know me then you know how reserved I can be or how challenging for me it is to be vulnerable; and that has a lot to do with trust. It’s not that I don’t trust a lot of people, rather I find it difficult to share my burdens. It is something that I had to learn in order to grow and I am still learning about it: to find Jesus in every person I surround myself with. Even though I don’t make it easy, being as reluctant and as hesitant as I am, I appreciate how patient Noel is in showing me that I can trust him…and that I can trust in Him.

Through the uphill battles and at the roadblocks I find myself in, Noel has gone out of his way many times to prove that I can confide in him. Although we are roommates, we made it a task to get to know each other as brothers-in-Christ on Tuesday nights but more importantly to enjoy the $1 per taco deal (not bad for some brotherly time).

Occasionally, I like to say to say that one of his purposes in life is to make me cry and it’s not one of those “make me laugh until I cry” things but to actually help me figure out how I feel about certain things even if at times they can feel heavy. He is able to constantly reassure me that I don’t have to carry my cross every single day lonesome and that, at times, he's willing to carry the heavy load.

I met Noel about two years ago, and I least expected these two things: to live with him and to form a great friendship with him.

One of his future dreams and plans include moving to the West Coast to work in adventure/wilderness therapy where he can combine his love of nature along with his desire to help children.
