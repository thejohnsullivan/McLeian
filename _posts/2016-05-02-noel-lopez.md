## "UNTITLED"

This is a **photo installment-slash-series** (and journal entry for an upcoming blog) that I have been thinking of creating for some time now not only to celebrate these lives and the amazing humans that live them but to also share the effect theyâ€™ve had on my own life and on the journey that I am willing to take on and finish along with them. Since I am usually not fond of nor quite great and eloquent in speaking high praises of people aloud, I thought this was second best and what made the most sense in order to put out the thoughts I have about these special people I am lucky to have in my life and the ones that have inspired me, so far, along the way.
