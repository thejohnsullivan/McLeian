### "ICELAND (2016)"

These are the things we carry with us, the things that we let define us. Our memories, our experiences, our beliefs, our scars, our truth; the things that hurt us, the things that makes us feel good, the things that makes us happy, the things that makes us feel loved, the things we leave behind, the things we expect to see in the future. **But what rocks our world, what makes it turn upside down, is when we let these things go.** What’s hard is to realize when we are no longer who we’re supposed to be, what we’re supposed to be, and where we’re supposed to be.

We are then faced with this challenge: to find ourselves back at a point, not necessarily of familiarity or comfort, but back on track. It may be at that point where things still seem very difficult, but there’s beauty in that kind of hurt and we have to realize that. There’s something poetic there; we may go through very tragic and painful moments but in the end, as we dream and as we hope, there is happiness. **With this kind of hope for that endless bliss, we must carry these things with us until we are home.**

One of the funniest and earliest memories I have with Noel happened when he started praying for a friendship between the two of us and all I could do was laugh. In that moment I thought it was kind of stupid, and I still joke about it with mentions of “Wow, I’m so glad we’ve formed this great acquaintanceship,” but I knew he was very serious since he just recently moved in with me at the time (and became an official **RoxBro**). I may have not appreciated that prayer then, but I definitely do now.

If you know me then you know how reserved I can be or how challenging for me it is to be vulnerable; and that has a lot to do with trust. It’s not that I don’t trust a lot of people, rather I find it difficult to share my burdens. It is something that I had to learn in order to grow and I am still learning about it: to find Jesus in every person I surround myself with. Even though I don’t make it easy, being as reluctant and as hesitant as I am, I appreciate how patient Noel is in showing me that I can trust him…and that I can trust in Him.

Through the uphill battles and at the roadblocks I find myself in, Noel has gone out of his way many times to prove that I can confide in him. Although we are roommates, we made it a task to get to know each other as brothers-in-Christ on Tuesday nights but more importantly to enjoy the $1 per taco deal (not bad for some brotherly time).

Occasionally, I like to say to say that one of his purposes in life is to make me cry and it’s not one of those “make me laugh until I cry” things but to actually help me figure out how I feel about certain things even if at times they can feel heavy. He is able to constantly reassure me that I don’t have to carry my cross every single day lonesome and that, at times, he's willing to carry the heavy load.

I met Noel about two years ago, and I least expected these two things: to live with him and to form a great friendship with him.

One of his future dreams and plans include moving to the West Coast to work in adventure/wilderness therapy where he can combine his love of nature along with his desire to help children.
