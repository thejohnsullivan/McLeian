### ICELAND (2016)

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/iceland2.JPG" %}

These are the things we carry with us, the things that we let define us. Our memories, our experiences, our beliefs, our scars, our truth; the things that hurt us, the things that makes us feel good, the things that makes us happy, the things that makes us feel loved, the things we leave behind, the things we expect to see in the future. **But what rocks our world, what makes it turn upside down, is when we let these things go.** What’s hard is to realize when we are no longer who we’re supposed to be, what we’re supposed to be, and where we’re supposed to be.

We are then faced with this challenge: to find ourselves back at a point, not necessarily of familiarity or comfort, but back on track. It may be at that point where things still seem very difficult, but there’s beauty in that kind of hurt and we have to realize that. There’s something poetic there; we may go through very tragic and painful moments but in the end, as we dream and as we hope, there is happiness. **With this kind of hope for that endless bliss, we must carry these things with us until we are home.**

Judith Thurman writes, *“Every dreamer knows that it is entirely possible to be homesick for a place you’ve never been to, perhaps more homesick than for familiar ground.”*

It’s almost been two months since I embarked on this trip, which for now I will call it a once-in-a-lifetime journey. It is crazy to even think about where the planning began and the amount of differing anxiety each of us felt beforehand. **This is always a desire of mine: to escape the city and discover new views.** To breathe in new air. To gain a new perspective. To fix my eyes on the world and the unknown that God had meant to be unfathomable.

Iceland has been one of those places. Situated in the Atlantic Ocean, not too far from Greenalnd, the island is undoubtedly one of the most subtly stunning countries out there. And even though the weather is quite harsh and unpredictable in the winter, after enough patience its beauty will show itself. **In every direction I turned, every single view was absolutely breathtaking; as every single worry, every single pain dissipated into the cold foreign air.**

All I could really think was, “This right here He created for me to see.” And that was enough, at that moment. To take in, to experience, and to appreciate God’s unquestionable existence.

**I yearned for this escape.** To see what was possible in order to force myself out a state of feeling broken. To see how much God is really trying to look out for me. And going to Iceland was a big part of that. In all that is beautiful and pure and untouched, in admiration of Him, I stood there as a man full of flaws, and yet He wants me; I needed to fully understand that in Him making me human was for me to have a relationship with Him.

All I needed to do was to give in and give up any inhibitions I had. **I needed to want Him.** After going through some of the hardest and most unexpected things, it took me a while, not necessarily to realize, but to come to the conclusion that maybe it is time to become, at most, vulnerable. To decide that maybe this emptiness and the confusing heaviness that comes with it can disappear if I just I let it.

My time in Iceland was an opportunity to reflect on and to make sense of the past year, as well as to escape the burden I felt being in Boston. Iceland is kind of how I imagine heaven to be: **breathtaking**. It was a place without fear, without worry, and without pain. It is full of dreams, full of hope, and full of endless possibilities.
