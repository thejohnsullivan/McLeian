#### <center>MALCOLM TAN</center>

Before coming to the US to attend Northeastern University to pursue a degree in Biochemistry, he joined the National Service in Singapore - a two-year requirement for all male citizens.

We met about two years ago when he came into the Boston Campus Ministry as a freshman. Honestly, I don’t remember when we became friends but I think we’ve become great enough friends to tolerate each other’s company for a whole week in LA.

Some things he enjoys: music, traveling, cold brew and horchata. You won’t believe how much horchata he had while we were in LA; I lost count after 10…

One thing I admire is his character. He inspires me to uphold integrity in people while still seeing the good in them.

Recently, we watched the wonderful Tori Kelly annihilate a show with her angelic voice.

As a stopover, on his way back to spend some time in Singapore with his family, I decided to join him in LA. I am grateful for the time we got to spend together; sharing with each other our dreams to become a better self each and every day for God.

This year, he helped his brother become his brother-in-Christ. It’s truly amazing to see all the things he has done as a disciple and still have the aspirations to do even more.

While in California, we got to eat some mouthwatering food, witness some incredible views, and spend time with some faithful people.

Malcolm is one of the most loyal people out there. He is thoroughly invested in his friendships, aiming to know and understand each person in his life.

***

This summer he is serving as a Global Service Intern in a HOPE Youth Corps program for HOPE Worldwide, a dream he’s had for a while.

I am excited to see where the next year takes this guy as he fulfills and checks off one personal and spiritual goal at a time.

I am so thankful for him and his consistent friendship. #TANdays
