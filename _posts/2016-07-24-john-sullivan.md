### <center>WEEK THREE</center>

#### <center>JOHN SULLIVAN</center>

One of my earliest memories of John was when he enthusiastically explained to me about “this guy who got baptized from this Footloose musical,” not knowing that he was talking to the THE exact guy.

Our friendship undeniably took a little bit of time but he has been there for me and seen me through some of the difficult moments in my life. Through advice and through some refreshing talks, he’s definitely helped me in understanding my purpose as a disciple.

During our free time, you might find us in our living room watching Netflix even though we must admit that most of this time is spent trying to figure out what to put on thus concluding on some re-watching of Parks and Rec episodes.

Last summer, John spent 6 months in California interning and working at the Apple campus. Going over there to spend a weekend with him was a much-needed time. He showed me around San Francisco and brought me down the Hecka Cool coast.

Even though I am older than he is, most of the time I can see him as an older brother. He has taught me how to appreciate life and how to rediscover my love for God. He is a constant reminder of what a man of God I need to be.

As we say and do some of the most foolish of things (mostly our stupid yet amazing remixes to songs), any time spent with John is quite memorable. Our trips to Plum Island, Walden Pond, and even just to Chick-Fil-A, our excursions away from the norm is as important to us as simply relaxing and staying inside our apartment.

One thing I appreciate about his character is his willingness to build on his friendships, strengthening the bond beyond roommates but forming a brotherhood that will likely last a lifetime.

This past March, we endeavored on an unforgettable journey around Iceland. I honestly cannot picture being on that trip without him.

We’ve seen the world and we dream on seeing and experiencing the rest of it, reaching every corner and calling out into the unknown.

John has recently asked the woman he so well-deserves, Madeleine, to be his wife. I cannot wait to watch him mature even more as he prepares to take this new step in his life.
