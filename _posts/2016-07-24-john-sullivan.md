### <center>WEEK THREE</center>

#### <center>JOHN SULLIVAN</center>

One of my earliest memories of John was when he enthusiastically explained to me about “this guy who got baptized from this Footloose musical,” not knowing that he was talking to the THE exact guy.

Our friendship undeniably took a little bit of time but he has been there for me and seen me through some of the difficult moments in my life. Through advice and through some refreshing talks, he’s definitely helped me in understanding my purpose as a disciple.

During our free time, you might find us in our living room watching Netflix even though we must admit that most of this time is spent trying to figure out what to put on thus concluding on some re-watching of Parks and Rec episodes.

Last summer, John spent 6 months in California interning and working at the Apple campus. Going over there to spend a weekend with him was a much-needed time. He showed me around San Francisco and brought me down the Hecka Cool coast.

Even though I am older than he is, most of the time I can see him as an older brother. He has taught me how to appreciate life and how to rediscover my love for God.

As we say and do some of the most foolish of things, any time spent with John is quite memorable. Our trips to Plum Island, Walden Pond, and even just to Chick-Fil-A, our excursions away from the norm is as important to us as simply relaxing and staying inside our apartment.

He has watched me jump because my own shadow, has heard me say random words in a french accent and we make up some of the greatest remixes of songs.

Malcolm is one of the most loyal people out there. He is thoroughly invested in his friendships, aiming to know and understand each person in his life.

This summer he is serving as a Global Service Intern in a HOPE Youth Corps program for HOPE Worldwide, a dream he’s had for a while.

I am excited to see where the next year takes this guy as he fulfills and checks off one personal and spiritual goal at a time.

I am so thankful for him and his consistent friendship. #TANdays
