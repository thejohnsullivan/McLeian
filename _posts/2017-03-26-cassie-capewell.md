In reference to John 14, “Jesus is kind of giving a last final charge to his disciples before he leaves earth and he’s comforting them about how he’s going to prepare a place for them in heaven.”

***

One my earliest memories of Cassie is her alien-themed birthday party. I think of that moment because it speaks volumes, not only about her quirkiness, but also about her passion of the unfathomable. And that’s who God is to most people in this world: this incomprehensible Creator. But believing in our Father comes easily to her. To her, she may not see Him yet she believes in Him. 

***

When asked of her dreams for God and for herself, “I really enjoy the fact that it’s still kind of up in the air and there’s many different possibilities so I’m kind of excited to figure it out and where God will take me.”

Cassie and I really grew in our friendship once we transitioned out of the Campus Ministry into Singles and were put into the same family group. I’m definitely grateful for her friendship during that time as she made that change in life-stage more comfortable.

***

“I think I have learned over the past few years that God created relationships to be such a special thing and heaven is the ultimate dream, obviously, but here on earth, I feel like friendships are so special and a little piece of heaven on earth."

***

Seeking friendships and forging relationships do not come easily to me, but Cassie has for sure played a vital part in creating a tight-knit bond between all our friends and making sure we do not lose sight of what it means to be a family of disciples.

****

“I am a very independent person and I’m strong-willed and I like doing things myself but God created my relationships to really be an asset to my life and help me to get to heaven one day and I really appreciate all that my friends are to me.”

Life can be challenging and to understand the difficulties we have to go through to grow in our faith can sometimes force us to doubt this journey. But someone like Cassie, who had pushed through her struggles and her doubts in her trust in God, is inspiring in keeping your head up and to continually dream of Heaven and of the things that has been promised to us.

“I just feel so blessed and thankful for what God has given me and the fact that I have a relationship with God. And it’s what motivates me to want this for other people as well.”
