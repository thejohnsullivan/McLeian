Braelan is one of the most supportive and compassionate people that I know. Investing deeply in the relationships she has with her friends, she feels for these people in ways nobody else can. From what I can remember, my friendship with her was one of the easiest to forge as she made it easy and comfortable to be around her. One of the greatest things about Braelan is her desire and urge to get to know people, to understand them beyond any situation.

What really inspires me about Braelan is her perseverance. Even though trust in God can be difficult especially at times of pain, constantly seeking contenment in Him is absolutely important. Through whatever she has gone through and whatever she continues to deal with, she refuses to let her relationship with God be determined by the temporary problems of this natural world.

When she speaks of the struggles she had to push through and continue to push through as a disciple, it reminds me of the scripture in Philippians. It is so easy to believe and to love and to trust God, and especially to feel blessed by Him, when things are going our way. But when things seem tough, it’s even easier to waver from our faith because the way we see our lives is not what we initially had expected or intended. Philippians 1:29 reminds me that believing in him also requires of me not to flee from my faith when things are too painful to deal with.

In reviving my confidence in God and in my sense of self, Braelan played an important part in helping me understand the potential of my dreams for God and for myself. By urging me to rid of my inhibitions and to leave behind my comfort, she inspired to serve God to discover more of Him and learn from others as well. With that experience, I think investing in other disciples’ lives and learning from their faith showed me how God continues to move in their lives, giving me hope how much He could mean for mine.

Two years ago, in order to love God more, to understand life more and to grow in ways I haven’t been able to, Braelan made me promise her that I would leave Boston. Because God is everywhere, I must fight to seek him in other places as well.
